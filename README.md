## Screenshots

!['Console'](https://github.com/nawfal-hussain/Linux-Compiler/assets/55346920/d6ba962e-b380-4580-afbe-a704b97ef000)
That is how the console looks like^
- At the very bottom you can write the commands you wish the compiler to execute and press 'enter'.

![Text Editor](https://github.com/nawfal-hussain/Linux-Compiler/assets/55346920/0d8b90b7-feb0-4b3a-b3d7-a15099125867)
That is what the text editor looks like^
- At the start it will be inaccessible.
- It will only become accessible when you type "gedit [filename]", after which you can write whatever you wish to save into [filename].
- Pressing save will save the data, and close the text editor.
- File name of any currently 'opened' file for editing will be displayed at the top of the text editor.

![Help Button](https://github.com/nawfal-hussain/Linux-Compiler/assets/55346920/01111098-4a9b-4eea-9204-4720fb9e0bd5)
At the very top right of the console will have a "help" button^
- Pressing the button will cause a info screen to pop up.
- Contains list of commands that the console can execute.
> (Not every Linux command can be run on this at this moment in time. Would like to work on this later on in life when I have more time and better skills xD)
## Ending thoughts

First 'major' HTML, CSS, and JS project that also uses API calling.
Was very difficult at fist to comprehend Node.js and Express.js but made it work in the end. Great learning experience.
